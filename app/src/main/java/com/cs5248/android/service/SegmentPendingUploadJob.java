/**
 * The idea is that there are two types of segment upload jobs: Live and Pending.
 * Live upload job is the intermediate one. If it fails, it will not be retried but instead will
 * spawn another job into the Pending queue, with lower priority.
 * <p>
 * Also, if at the time the execution starts, and the segment is no longer the latest one recorded
 * by the camera, it will be skipped and pushed into the pending queue.
 * <p>
 * This way, the upload might not be in sequential order and it requires the server to be smart
 * about it, able to tolerate non-consecutive segment IDs.
